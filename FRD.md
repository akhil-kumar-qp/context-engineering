   - Purpose: Acknowledge and process negative feelings

3. "What can you do to improve yourself tomorrow?"
   - Focus: Growth opportunities, actionable steps, learning
   - Type: Required field
   - Purpose: Forward-thinking planning and development

**Business Rules:**
- One submission per day maximum
- Cannot modify or delete after submission

- Clear visual indication of current section
- Automatic state management based on submission status
- Responsive design for various devices
- Fast loading and smooth interactions

**Business Rules:**
- If today's reflection is complete, emphasize historical view
- If today's reflection is pending, emphasize current entry
- Provide clear feedback for all user actions
- Maintain simplicity to encourage daily use

### 4. Data Persistence and Security

**Purpose:** Ensure reliable data storage and user privacy

**Requirements:**
- Save reflection data securely
- Maintain data integrity across sessions
- Handle network connectivity issues gracefully
- Provide appropriate loading and error states

**Business Rules:**
- Data must persist between browser sessions
- No data loss during submission process
- Graceful degradation if services are unavailable
- User privacy and data security maintained

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

**As a user, I want to:**
1. Submit my daily reflection so that I can maintain a consistent journaling habit
2. View my past reflections so that I can track my personal growth over time
3. Be prevented from editing submitted reflections so that I maintain honest, authentic entries
4. See today's date clearly so that I know I'm reflecting on the correct day
5. Have a simple, distraction-free interface so that I can focus on meaningful reflection

### Secondary User Stories

**As a user, I want to:**
1. See character limits so that I can write appropriate length responses
2. Receive confirmation when my reflection is saved so that I know it was successful
3. Have the app remember my submission status so that I don't accidentally submit twice
4. Navigate easily between today's entry and past reflections
5. Use the app on my phone or computer with the same experience

## Success Criteria

### User Experience Success

- Interface is intuitive without requiring instructions
- No user reports of losing reflection data
- High user engagement with historical review feature

### Technical Success
- App loads within 3 seconds on standard devices
- Form validation prevents incomplete submissions
- Historical data displays accurately and completely
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop

### Business Success

- Reminder notifications or scheduling
- Advanced analytics or reporting
- Customization of reflection questions
- Integration with external services
- Data backup and recovery features

## Notes for Development Team

This application prioritizes simplicity and consistency over advanced features. The goal is to create a tool that users will want to use daily, which means the interface must be clean, fast, and reliable. Focus on the core reflection experience and ensure it works perfectly before considering any additional features.

The three-question framework is carefully designed to balance positive reflection (achievements) with honest self-assessment (anxieties) and forward-thinking growth (improvements). This structure should be maintained to ensure the app delivers on its personal development objectives.

Remember that this is a context engineering exercise - developers should build this application using the provided requirements and their understanding of modern web development practices, without step-by-step coding guidance.
